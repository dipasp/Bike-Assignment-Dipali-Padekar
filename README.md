# Bike-Sharing-Assignment
### Problem Statement:

A bike-sharing system allows individuals to rent bikes on a short-term basis, either for a fee or for free. These systems typically operate with computer-controlled docking stations, where users enter their payment details to unlock a bike, which can then be returned to any other station within the same network. One such provider, **BoomBikes**, has experienced a significant decline in revenue due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As the business struggles to stay afloat amid the current market conditions, BoomBikes aims to devise a strategic business plan to boost revenue once the pandemic restrictions ease and the economy begins to recover.

In light of this, BoomBikes seeks to understand the demand for bike-sharing services after the lockdown ends, especially in the context of changes in people's behavior due to COVID-19. The companyâ€™s goal is to be well-prepared to meet the expected demand when the situation improves, positioning itself to outperform competitors and maximize profits.

To achieve this, BoomBikes has hired a consulting firm to identify the key factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the U.S. market. Specifically, they are interested in:
- **Which variables significantly impact the demand for shared bikes**.
- **How well these variables can predict the demand for bikes**.

The firm has collected a comprehensive dataset on daily bike usage across the American market, incorporating various factors including weather conditions and demographic trends. This data will be analyzed to provide insights into what drives bike-sharing demand and help BoomBikes plan for the future.
